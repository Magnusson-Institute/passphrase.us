This tool is completely encapsulated in a single HTML file
(index.html), therefore it works locally - you can download the file
and run it as a static file. When it's being used, it does not
require any other files, libraries, servers, etc.

It uses two sources of entropy: your physical mouse/finger movements together
with your browser's best effort (*)
